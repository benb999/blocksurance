# Mobile App
A Mobile App developed using web technologies, Ionic Framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript, which are compiled to hybrid mobile app using the the Corvova toolset, which wraps our HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing us to easily write one set of code to target nearly every phone or tablet on the market today and publish to their app stores.
